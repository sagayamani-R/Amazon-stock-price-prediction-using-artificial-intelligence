I've always been in blue everywhere. When Mumbai and Indians come together then it becomes Mumbai Indians,\" Tendulkar told Aakash Chopra on the latter's Youtube channel.\"All teams are quite balanced. This format is such that by the time you play, a lot has already transpired on the field. We can look at this in two ways. Batsmen who seem to be in a hurry are cautioned to take it easy, while those who are extremely relaxed at times are required to take swift actions. It is going to be an exciting competition, and matches will be evenly contested. Considering the 53-day duration of the tournament, the team with momentum on its side might prevail.\"Tendulkar also spoke about the importance of starting well. However, Mumbai Indians' run of defeats in their opening matches in the IPL continued on Saturday when they were beaten by Chennai Super Kings in Abu Dhabi.\"Even while playing a Test series, we stress on performing well in the first game. If we play well in the first game, the series will finish well. Same applies here as well. If the beginning is good, the team meetings are also short, and that holds the team in good stead,\" said the 47-year-old.    58\n",
       "       ROME: Novak Djokovic knows it isn't model behavior when he loses his cool on the tennis court.Yet he just can't help himself.Exactly two weeks after he was defaulted from the US Open , and a day after he was warned by the chair umpire for breaking his racket, Djokovic received an obscenity warning midway through a 7-5, 6-3 win over Casper Ruud in the Italian Open semifinals on Sunday.As opposed to his previous two outbursts, this time there were fans in the stands who could clearly hear how Djokovic dealt with his frustration.What's more is that, with 1,000 spectators allowed into the Foro Italico for the first time this week, a large proportion of those in attendance were children.\"I don't want to do it, but when it comes, it happens,\" Djokovic said Saturday. \"That's how I, I guess, release sometimes my anger. And it's definitely not the best message out there, especially for the young tennis players looking at me. I don't encourage that - definitely.\"Djokovic's behavior once again overshadowed his performance, in a match where he had to save two set points when Ruud served for the first set at 5-4 - one of them with a delicate backhand drop-shot winner.The top-ranked Djokovic also served five aces in a single game to take a 6-5 lead in the first.Ruud, 21, the first Norwegian player to contest a Masters 1000 semifinal and a product of Rafael Nadal's academy, put up plenty of resistance and also produced the shot of the day: a leaping over-the-shoulder hook shot for a winner as he raced back to chase down a lob - earning a thumbs-up from Djokovic.The obscenity warning came in the third game of the second set, by which time he had a running dialogue with the chair umpire over a series of contested calls.Still, Djokovic improved to 30-1 this year. His only loss came when he was thrown out of the US Open for unintentionally hitting a line judge in the throat with a ball during his fourth-round match against Pablo Carreno Busta.In Djokovic's 10th Rome final - he has won four - he\"ll face either eighth-seeded Diego Schwartzman or 12th-seeded Denis Shapovalov.Schwartzman beat nine-time Rome champion Nadal late Friday.In the women's tournament, top-seeded Simona Halep reached her third Rome final by beating Garbine Muguruza 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 to improve her record in tennis' restart to 9-0.Muguruza struggled with her serve and double faulted on the final two points of the 2 hour, 16-minute match.Halep, who lost to Elina Svitolina in the 2017 and 2018 finals, will face either Karolina Pliskova or Marketa Vondrousova in Monday's championship match.The second-ranked Halep is 13-0 overall stretching back to February, when she won a title in Dubai. After the tour's five-month break due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Romanian returned by raising another trophy in Prague last month. She then skipped the US Open due to travel and health concerns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   55\n",

The results showed that the video is from a mock drill that was exercised at the Blaise Diagne Airport in Dakar, Senegal in November, 2019.\\n\\nThe video was shot a month before the first few cases of the novel Coronavirus was reported in December 2019 in China.\\n\\nThe initial search results took us to a longer video uploaded to YouTube in January 2020. The video has been captioned in French as, \"a great misfortune in Senegal\". Taking clues from this, we broke the longer video into keyframes and ran a reverse image search which showed articles stating that the video was actually a training exercise.\\n\\nThe training exercise was carried out in November 2019 at the Blaise Diagne Airport in Dakar where police and members of staff practiced a hostage-taking scenario reported the Thiès Info. The headline of the article when translated reads, \"Exercise at AIBD: airport security as a show of strength\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, the article includes an 11.52 minutes YouTube video, that was uploaded on November 28, 2019, with the caption (in French) that reads, \"AIBD Crisis management exercise application of the emergency plan\". The video also includes a press conference by officials where glimpses of volunteers during the exercise can be seen.\\n\\nAt the press conference after the exercise, Xavier Mary, the director-general of LAS (Limak-Aibd-Summa), organiser of the mock drill, thanked Air Senegal for the provision of an aircraft. He was also quoted as saying, that the organisation is in the process of progress in terms of crisis management, stated the website Dakaractu.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Dakaractu article includes a 4.33 minutes video uploaded on November 28, 2019, with the same visuals as in the viral video.

Then in the second half we made a lot of mistakes.\"Had we scored in the first half it would have changed everything.\"In Florence, Franck Ribery wore Fiorentina captain's armband for the first match of the new campaign.New Torino coach Marco Giampaolo could thank goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu for keeping his side in the game pulling off two quickfire saves on Ivorian Christian Kouame just before the break.The breakthrough came in the 78th minute when Federico Chiesa teed up Castrovilli to beat Sirigu.Torino captain Andrea Belotti thought he had grabbed a point deep into injury time but was ruled offside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
